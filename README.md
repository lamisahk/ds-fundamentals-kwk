## The repo includes:
- **Scrapers**: Pull registrar/academic calendars (MIT, Harvard, BU, Tufts, UMass Boston, BC).  
- **Cleaner**: Standardizes finals calendars, fills gaps, and merges with Google Trends.  
- **Visualization Maker**: Jupyter notebook producing line charts, overlap plots, heatmaps, and event studies.

## Key Insights
- **Pizza demand spikes**: Clear rise in searches during finals weeks.  
- **Pre-finals ramp**: Searches begin rising ~1 week before finals start.  
- **Overlap effect**: The more schools in finals at once, the stronger the spike.  
- **Coffee check**: Coffee searches also rise, supporting the ‚Äúquick food demand‚Äù story.

## How AI Helped
- Assisted with repetitive tasks like generating rolling averages and plotting templates.  
- Supported narrative framing, but **all analysis, cleaning, and interpretation were my own work**.
